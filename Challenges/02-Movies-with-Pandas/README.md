**Pandas Challenges**


**Topic**: Pandas (Exploring and visualizing our scraped movie data in pandas)

Just getting started? Read this guide: [10 minutes to pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)

**Data**: Your own data! But: if you don't have movie data to work on yet, you can use some data on the top grossing 100 movies from 2013, scraped from Box Office Mojo: `2013_movies.csv`


---


**Challenge 1**

Plot domestic total gross over time.


**Challenge 2**

Plot runtime vs. domestic total gross.


**Challenge 3**

Group your data by Rating and find the average runtime and domestic total gross at each level of Rating.


**Challenge 4**

Make one figure with (N=the number of MPAA ratings there are) subplots, and in each plot the release date vs the domestic total gross.


**Challenge 5**

What director in your dataset has the highest gross per movie?


**Challenge 6**

Bin your dataset into months and make a bar graph of the mean domestic total gross by month.  Error bars will represent the standard error of the mean.

Title of graph should include:  Mean Domestic Total Gross by Month in 2013

Topic for consideration:  what is the correct formula for the standard error of the mean?  Examine the error bars and see if they are "reasonable."
